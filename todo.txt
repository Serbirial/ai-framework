### TODO: Implement In-Memory Caching for Persona Prompt Generation

- Cache the result of `get_persona_prompt(userid)` to avoid regenerating the persona prompt on every call.
- Store cached prompts in a dictionary keyed by `userid`.
- Invalidate (clear) the cached prompt for a user whenever their personality data or core memory changes, including:
  - After `add_to_remember()` modifies the user's memory.
  - After updates to personality traits, goals, likes, or dislikes (need to detect or trigger cache clearing).
- Provide a method to manually clear the cache for a specific user or all users.
